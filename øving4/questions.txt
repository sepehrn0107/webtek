1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?

  Since it's likely that mobile phones will be using metered data to visit websites,
  auto play has been disabled to save on data usage. 


  2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a device with 320 x 568 resolution?
There is no element with the id "logo", but if there was, that element wouldn't be visible and wouldn't take up any space on the webpage
if the device had a defined width between 768px and 1024px.

  3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
If someone was on the mobile site, and wanted to send a link to that site, the link would direct the users to a mobile site, even if they were on a desktop.
Another advantage is that you don't have to have redundant code, you can just change the parts of the site that needs to be changed, using media queries.
